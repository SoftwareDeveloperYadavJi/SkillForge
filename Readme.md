# SkillForge

A decentralized micro-skilling platform where individuals can teach or learn micro-skills (small, focused skills like "How to create an API in Django," "How to fix a specific bug in React," etc.). Unlike existing learning platforms, SkillForge focuses on micro-learning with rapid deployment of user-generated micro-courses that are verified via a peer-review system.
